Title: My dress up darling
Description: Wakana Gojou is a fifteen year old high-school boy who 
             was socially traumatized in the past due to his passions. That incident
             left a mark on him that made him into a social recluse. Until one day
             he had an encounter with Kitagawa who is a sociable gyaru, who is the
             complete opposite of him. They soon share their passions with one another
             which leads to their odd relationship.
